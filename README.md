# Junior Solidity Assignment

The goal of this technical assignment is to demonstrate your ability to:

1. Produce quality Solidity code
2. Follow best practices

It is designed to take no more than a few hours. 

## Overview

This assignment is to be written in `Solidity` using `Hardhat` for testing. Parts 1 and 2 are compulsory, part 3 is for optional bonus points.

## Getting setup

Ensure you have installed:

* NodeJS 14+
* Yarn (_install using `npm i -g yarn`_)
* Hardhat (_install using `npm install --save-dev hardhat`_)

Clone this repo locally and publish your changes to a private repo, adding BenSparksCode, TamaraRingas and Saksijas as contributors. 

## Instructions

### Part 1

Make an `ERC20` token called `COIN`. In your contract, make it so that the owner can `enable/disable transfers` of `Coin`. Test this contract in `TypeScript or Javascript in Hardhat`.

### Part 2

Make an `NFT` where users can only mint an `NFT` by paying `1000 COIN` (the `ERC20` above) to the `NFT contract`. Test this contract in `TypeScript or Javascript in Hardhat`.

### Part 3 (Bonus Points)
1. Deploy project to a testnet
2. Acheive 100% statement test coverage
